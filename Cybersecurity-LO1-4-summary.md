- **Security Goal Categories**: 
  - **Strategic**: Long-term alignment with business objectives.
  - **Tactical**: Medium-term actions like disaster recovery.
  - **Operational**: Short-term, specific security tasks.
- **Due Care vs. Due Diligence**:
  - **Due Care**: Acting responsibly to avoid risks (e.g., training employees).
  - **Due Diligence**: Thoroughly assessing risks (e.g., conducting security audits).
- **Compliance**: Meeting external regulations (e.g., GDPR) and internal security policies to ensure ethical business operations.

#### **2. Risk Management and Security Documentation**
- **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and managing risks to protect assets.
- **Risk Assessment Types**:
  - **Qualitative**: Descriptive labels for risks (e.g., high, medium).
  - **Quantitative**: Numerical evaluation of risks (e.g., financial impact).
- **Risk Responses**: **Avoidance**, **Mitigation**, **Transfer**, and **Acceptance** to handle risks.
- **Security Documentation**: Policies, Standards, Procedures, and Baselines that define security practices within the organization.

### **Learning Outcome 2 (LO2): Data and Asset Management**
#### **1. Asset Management and Data Classification**
- **Data Classification**: Categorizing data based on sensitivity to apply appropriate controls.
- **Military vs. Commercial Classification**: 
  - **Military**: Rigid classifications (Top Secret).
  - **Commercial**: Flexible, focusing on corporate needs (e.g., Trade Secrets).
- **Private Data Ownership**: Individuals own their data; organizations act as custodians.
- **Asset Management Roles**: Include the **Data Owner**, **Custodian**, **System Owner**, and **Auditor**.

#### **2. Retention, Handling, and Security Policies**
- **Data Handling**:
  - **Data States**: 
    - **Data at Rest**: Data stored in databases, requiring encryption.
    - **Data in Transit**: Data moving across networks, secured by SSL/TLS.
    - **Data in Use**: Data being processed, protected by secure enclaves.
- **Retention and Destruction**:
  - **Retention Policies**: Define how long data is kept.
  - **Data Destruction**: **Erasing**, **Overwriting**, **Degaussing**, and **Physical Destruction** are methods used for ensuring data is unrecoverable.
  
### **Learning Outcome 3 (LO3): Enterprise Security Architecture and Virtualization**
#### **1. Security Design and Architecture Principles**
- **Least Privilege**: Users are granted only the access needed to perform their job.
- **Separation of Duties**: Prevents one person from controlling all critical aspects, reducing fraud and errors.
- **Enterprise Security Architecture (ESA)**:
  - **Building Blocks**: 
    - **Boundary Control**: Regulates data flow.
    - **Access Control**: Verifies user identity.
    - **Integrity Services**: Ensure data accuracy and consistency.
    - **Cryptographic Services**: Protect confidentiality.
    - **Auditing/Monitoring Services**: Oversight and threat detection.

#### **2. Risk Management for Virtualization and Cloud**
- **Virtualization Risks**:
  - **VM Escape**: Virtual machines accessing unauthorized areas.
  - **Single Point of Failure**: One host affecting multiple virtual machines.
  - **Mitigation**: Strong isolation, hypervisor patching.
- **Cloud Services Risk Mitigations**:
  - **Encryption**, **Access Control**, **SLA Reviews** for strong security practices.
- **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**:
  - **Mitigations**: Layered network architecture, role-based access, and secure intrusion detection.

#### **3. Critical Security Controls**
- **Examples of Critical Security Controls**:
  - **Device Inventory**: Tracking authorized/unauthorized devices.
  - **Vulnerability Assessments**: Identifying potential weaknesses.
  - **Audit Logs Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of system activities.

### **Learning Outcome 4 (LO4): Security Operations and Incident Handling**
#### **1. Physical and Logical Security Concepts**
- **Perimeter vs. Internal Security**: **Perimeter** (e.g., fences, CCTV) vs. **Internal** (e.g., card readers, guards).
- **Layered Protection**: Ensures multiple layers of defense to protect the organization.
- **Physical Access Logs**: Track entry and exit into secure areas, crucial for auditing.

#### **2. Incident and Change Management**
- **Incident Management**:
  - **Purpose**: Respond quickly to minimize damage from security incidents.
  - **Process**: Detection -> Evaluation -> Mitigation -> Recovery.
- **Change Management**:
  - **Purpose**: Control IT changes to maintain security and stability.
  - **Process**: Request -> Approval -> Implementation -> Reporting.
- **Patch Management**: Automate and track software updates to reduce vulnerabilities.

#### **3. Digital Evidence and Chain of Custody**
- **Evidence Collection**:
  - **Process**: Secure the site, collect volatile data, create exact copies.
- **Chain of Custody**: Maintain the evidence trail to ensure its integrity for legal proceedings.

#### **4. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Security Measures**
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized data access or leaks.
- **Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting**:
  - **Whitelisting**: Only allow approved entities (more secure but restrictive).
  - **Blacklisting**: Block known threats (less restrictive but can miss new threats).
- **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)**: Central repository to manage IT assets.
  
### **Key Concepts Across Learning Outcomes**:
- **Access Control Models**:
  - **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Owner-controlled access permissions.
  - **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Centralized control based on classification.
- **Least Privilege, Job Rotation, and Separation of Duties**:
  - Ensure that employees do not accumulate excessive control or access.
  - Helps reduce insider threats and distribute responsibilities.
- **Continuous Security Monitoring**:
  - **SIEM Tools**: Aggregate and correlate logs to detect anomalies in real-time.
