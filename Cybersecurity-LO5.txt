### Learning Outcome Five (Full Set of Questions and Answers)

1. **Explain the concept of Access Control.**  
   Access control defines who can interact with resources, either physical or logical, by limiting access based on set rules or roles. It uses "subjects" (like users, systems, or processes) and "objects" (resources to be accessed). Proper access control ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability by managing how and when users or systems can access data and resources.

2. **Name and explain different types of Access Control services.**  
   There are four types of access control services: **Identification and Authentication (I&A)** ensures a unique identity is established and verified for any user; **Authorization** determines what actions a user is allowed to perform; **Audit** involves keeping logs of activities for accountability; and **Accountability** ensures these logs are reviewed so actions can be traced back to the user responsible.

3. **Explain the Identity and Access Provisioning Lifecycle.**  
   The Identity and Access Provisioning Lifecycle involves **provisioning**, **review**, and **deprovisioning**. **Provisioning** creates accounts and assigns permissions. **Review** ensures ongoing appropriate access. **Deprovisioning** removes access when it's no longer needed. This lifecycle ensures effective control and management of user identities and access privileges throughout their life in the system.

4. **Explain the importance of Identity Management.**  
   Identity management is key to ensuring that users have the correct access rights, and nothing more. It helps protect sensitive resources, reduce unauthorized access, and meet regulatory requirements by managing identifiers like usernames, passwords, and roles consistently across multiple systems.

5. **Explain the process of Identity Management.**  
   Identity management starts with **Identification**—assigning a unique ID like a username. **Authentication** follows, verifying that ID using methods like passwords or biometrics. **Authorization** then decides what a verified user can do, ensuring appropriate access levels to resources are maintained.

6. **Name and explain some Identification Type Weaknesses.**  
   **ID cards** can be easily copied. **User IDs** can be stolen via social engineering. **Email addresses** are vulnerable to spoofing, and **account numbers/PINs** are easy to guess, especially if they use personal information. **MAC addresses** can be modified or spoofed. Mitigating these weaknesses involves using **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, secure password practices, and training users about risks.

7. **Name and explain four Authentication Types.**  
   The four types are: **something you know** (e.g., passwords or PINs), **something you have** (e.g., tokens, smart cards), **something you are** (e.g., biometrics like fingerprints or facial recognition), and **somewhere you are** (e.g., geographical location verification). Combining them increases security.

8. **Explain the difference between false rejection rates (FRRs) and false acceptance rates (FARs) in Biometric authentication.**  
   **FRR (False Rejection Rate)** occurs when a legitimate user is wrongly denied access. **FAR (False Acceptance Rate)** is when an unauthorized user is incorrectly granted access. Balancing both is crucial—if the system is too strict, users are inconvenienced; if it’s too lenient, security is compromised.

9. **Explain the difference between authentication and authorization.**  
   **Authentication** is verifying a user’s identity, asking "Who are you?" **Authorization** defines what that user can do once verified, asking "What actions are you allowed to perform?" Authentication checks identity, while authorization grants permissions.

10. **Explain the concept of Accountability.**  
   **Accountability** means being able to trace actions to a specific user or entity. To achieve accountability, systems require unique identifiers, audit trails, and logging. This ensures that actions are recorded and traceable, helping detect issues and enforce policies.

11. **Explain advantages and disadvantages of the Single Sign-On (SSO).**  
   **SSO** allows users to log in once to access multiple systems, improving convenience and reducing password fatigue. The disadvantage is the **single point of failure**—if SSO credentials are compromised, an attacker gains access to all connected systems. **MFA**, strong passwords, and monitoring can mitigate risks.

12. **Name and explain different types of Identity Federation Methods.**  
   **Identity federation** enables identities to be shared across different systems. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** allows data exchange between identity providers and service providers. **OAuth** is used by APIs to authorize third-party applications to access user information, adding flexibility and security to multi-system interactions.

13. **Explain the importance of Granular Authorization Control.**  
   **Granular Authorization Control** allows precise control over what actions a user can take. This level of control ensures that users have the least privilege necessary for their tasks, reducing risk by minimizing unnecessary access.

14. **Explain the concept of Access Control Attacks.**  
   **Access control attacks** target weaknesses in access management. Examples include **brute force attacks** (guessing passwords until correct), **session hijacking** (taking over an active session), and **SQL injection** (using code to bypass authentication). Proper password policies, secure session management, and input validation help mitigate these risks.

15. **Name and explain some Software-Based Access Control Attacks.**  
   **Software-based access control attacks** include password cracking (e.g., **brute force** or **dictionary attacks**) and using exploits like **SQL injection** to bypass login processes. **Secure coding practices**, **input validation**, and encryption can prevent these attacks.

16. **Name and explain some Social Engineering Access Control Attacks.**  
   Common attacks include **phishing** (sending fake emails to trick users into revealing credentials), **pretexting** (creating a fake scenario to obtain sensitive information), and **baiting** (using enticing offers to lure users into giving up credentials). **User awareness training** and **MFA** are effective defenses.

17. **Name and explain some Human-Based Access Control Attacks.**  
   **Human-based attacks** involve exploiting people to gain unauthorized access. Examples are **shoulder surfing** (watching someone type a password) and **tailgating** (following someone into a secure area). Using physical barriers and enhancing vigilance can help prevent these attacks.

18. **Name and explain some Physical Access Control Attacks.**  
   Physical attacks include **lock-picking**, **using stolen keys**, or bypassing security at doors to gain access. Effective mitigation involves physical safeguards such as **stronger locks**, **biometric entry systems**, and **access control policies**.

19. **A mid-sized enterprise is implementing a new identity management system to streamline user access across multiple applications. However, the IT team is concerned about potential identification weaknesses that could allow unauthorized access. As the security lead, identify some common identification type weaknesses and recommend strategies the company can implement to mitigate these vulnerabilities.**  
   Common weaknesses include **easily copied ID cards**, **user IDs** being stolen through social engineering, **email address spoofing**, and **modifiable MAC addresses**. To mitigate these, use **MFA** for extra verification, **strong password policies**, **training employees** on social engineering risks, and biometric systems when possible.

20. **A financial institution is deploying a biometric authentication system in its customer service centers. They are analyzing the system's accuracy by reviewing false rejection rates (FRRs) and false acceptance rates (FARs). Explain the significance of these metrics in biometric systems and recommend how the institution can balance security and user convenience when configuring the system.**  
   **FRR** denies access to legitimate users, while **FAR** grants access to unauthorized users. To balance these, the financial institution must adjust the system's sensitivity. Setting an optimal level keeps it convenient yet secure. Combining biometrics with **MFA** also strengthens security.

21. **A multinational company is using a single sign-on (SSO) solution to improve user experience and security. However, some stakeholders have expressed concerns about the potential risks of using SSO. Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of SSO for the company and suggest additional security measures they can implement to address the risks associated with SSO.**  
   **SSO** makes access easier and reduces password fatigue, but it creates a **single point of failure**. If credentials are stolen, all systems are compromised. To mitigate this, use **strong passwords**, **MFA**, and **continuous monitoring** to catch suspicious behavior early.

22. **A global tech company recently experienced a social engineering attack, where an employee was tricked into revealing login credentials. Analyze the types of social engineering attacks the company might face in the context of access control and recommend specific mitigation strategies to prevent future incidents.**  
   Attacks include **phishing** (tricking via emails) and **pretexting** (fabricated scenarios to gather information). To prevent these, the company should implement **regular training**, **MFA**, and stricter verification processes for handling sensitive data requests.

23. **A healthcare organization is deploying granular access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient information. However, they are facing challenges in managing the complexity of granular permissions across departments. As a security consultant, discuss the importance of granular authorization control and recommend best practices for managing these permissions while maintaining security and efficiency.**  
   **Granular authorization control** ensures that each employee has the least privilege necessary. To manage this complexity, use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, which groups users by role, and **automated tools** to monitor and manage permissions. Conduct regular **access reviews** to keep permissions up-to-date and minimize excess access.
